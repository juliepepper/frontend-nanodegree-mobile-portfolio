## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

2. Copied the public URL ngrok gave: https://9accfe81.ngrok.io/dist/ and ran it through PageSpeed Insights.

Started with a score of 29/100 on mobile and roughly the same on desktop.  Took suggestions of optimizing images and minifying files and looked to optimize through grunt.

 Created a Gruntfile.js and a package.json listing tasks and registering them.

 Ran grunt, found errors, worked through them and got a slightly higher pagespeed.

 Images: Did some manual manipulation of imagery through preview and Imageoptim to optimize further.

 CSS: Inlined it and added HTML media="print" to the external style sheet to link print styles.

 JS: Added async tags and put js at the bottom of HTML

 Modified Gruntfile.js and package.json and ran it again.

 Got an improved pagespeed score of 96/100 for mobile and 97100 for desktop.

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js.

1. Created src directory and ran grunt again to have dist directory mirror the files in src.
2. Modified views/js/main.js

Reduced sliding pizza elements generated, down from 200, to 24.

Addressed CSS Animation:
Added the CSS hack backface-visibility: hidden: to the mover class.
Applied TranslateX() and TranslateZ(0) to updatePositions function.

Fixed a typo in the global adjectives array to match the getAdj function name "noisy" so that "noise," read "noisy".

Moved the calculation which controls scroll top method, outside the loop to improve efficiency.
Resized the pizzas to improve efficiency: moved determineDx out of loop, moved newwidth calculation, and created a new variable to hold all of the .randomPizzaContainer elements in the document looping through the elements to apply the new width value. Moved the elements to above the dx so the DOM wasn't called three times.

Optimized concurrent animations that run together into a single reflow and repaint cycle by adding the updateFunctions parameter to the window.requestAnimationFrame method in the scroll event listener.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
